    <p>I'm 21 years old and currently attending BYU-Idaho. I'm studying Software Engineering and works on campus in the IT governance office.</p>
    <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Running</li>
        <li>Playing sports</li>
        <li>Hanging with friends</li>
        <li>Cooking</li>

    <h2>My Family</h2>
    <p>I am the fifth kid out of my parents six and I love coming from such a large family. We were all raised in Texas, but currently only my parents and one of my siblings live there. The rest of us reside in Idaho, Utah and Colorado. My siblings and I love to play spikeball and pickleball together.</p>
    <h2>What's Next for Ashlynn?</h2>
    <p>I plan on spending the next 3 years in Rexburg getting my Bachelor's degree. After which, I'd love to work back in Texas to be closer to my family. </p>
