    <h2>My Family</h2>
    <p>I am the fifth kid out of my parents six and I love coming from such a large family. We were all raised in Texas, but currently only my parents and one of my siblings live there. The rest of us reside in Idaho, Utah and Colorado. I am closest with my younger sister, Sylisa. Though I'm 18 months older than her, she towers a whole 5 inches above me. Though closest with Sylisa, I consider myself to be really close with all my siblings and love to do various activities with them all. Blaine and I bond over video games and I let him tell me all about cars despite my lack of knowledge on the matter. Sam and I both love music and every Friday send each other our favorite songs from that week. Sydi and I bond over working together and our love for clothes and shoes. If I ever need fashion adice, she is definitely my girl. Amanda and I are obsessed with playing Among Us together and playing spikeball or pickleball. When we're all together my whole family loves to play card games and compete for the highest score on Bop It.</p>
    <h2>What's Next for Ashlynn?</h2>
    <p>I plan on spending the next 3 years in Rexburg getting my Bachelor's degree. After which, I'd love to work in web development and hopefully get married and have children along the way. </p>
